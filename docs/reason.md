## âœ¨ Reason

At [CBPF](https://cbpf.br), where I work, we use LDAP Admin to make small adjustments to our OpenLDAP server. However, LDAP Admin is a Windows-only tool, which creates issues for team members who use macOS or Linux. To solve this, I developed Ldap-Nel, a web-based application that can be accessed from any platform, anywhereâ€”making LDAP management more accessible and convenient for the whole team.\
I also wanted to learn Go ðŸ˜„
